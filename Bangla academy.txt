****Bangla academy****

The Bangla Academy is Bangladesh's national language authority, established in 1955. It is located 
in Burdwan House in Ramna, Dhaka, within the grounds of the University of Dhaka and Suhrawardy Udyan.
The Bangla Academy hosts the annual Ekushey Book Fair. The importance of establishing an organisation 
for Bengali language was first emphasised by the linguist Muhammad Shahidullah.Later, following 
the Language movement, on 27 April 1952, the All Party National Language Committee decided to demand 
establishment of an organisation for the promotion of Bengali language. During the 1954 parliamentary 
elections, the United Front's 21-point manifesto stated that, "The prime minister from the United 
Front will dedicate the Bardhaman House for establishing a research center for the Bengali language".
In 1955, the government formed a committee to expedite the process. The committee was composed of 
leading intellectuals like Muhammad Shahidullah, Qazi Motahar Hossain, S.M. Bhattacharya, W. H. Shadani, 
and Muhammad Barkatullah. On 3 December 1955, the Chief Minister of East Bengal, Abu Hussain Sarkar, 
inaugurated the institute. Barkatullah acted as the Special Officer in charge. Later, in 1956, Muhammad 
Enamul Haque took over as the first director. The first book published by the academy was Laili Maznu, 
an epic by the medieval poet Dawlat Ujir Bahram Khan, and edited by Ahmed Sharif. The first fellow of 
the academy was the poet Farrukh Ahmed.
The main task of the Academy is to conduct research on Bengali language, culture, and history, and to publish 
Bengali literary and research work. To commemorate the Language movement and the Language martyr's day, the 
Academy organizes the month-long Ekushey Book Fair, the largest book fair in the country.
