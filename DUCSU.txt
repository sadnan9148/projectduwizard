****DUCSU****

DUCSU - Dhaka University Central Students'Union. One of the most significant contributes of DUCSU 
was to prioduce a number of High -profile student leaders who later emerged as national leaders. 
Most importantly, DUCSU  leaders led some of the most important political movements in our history- 
the Language Movement in 1952, mas uprising in '69, the Liberation War in 1971 and the anti-autocracy 
movement in 1991. In 2nd March, 1971, the then vice-president of DUCSU ASM AbdurRab hoisted the national 
flag of independent Bangladesh on behalf of Shwadhin Bangla Chatra Sangram Parishad top the DU Arts 
Building. Formed in 1924, three years after Dhaka Univesity was established, DUCSU had its first election 
in 1953.Ironically, the practice of election in this most prestigious student body of Bangladesh was brought 
to halt after our ascent to democracy in  1991.
