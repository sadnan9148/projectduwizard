first art school in the region and became the main centre of art and cultural practice. Since 
1956 it has been situated in Shahbag, Dhaka, close to the Bangladesh National Museum. Architect 
Muzharul Islam designed the building. In 2008, the institute took its current name when it became 
one of the faculties of the University of Dhaka. With the leadership of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin
